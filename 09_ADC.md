# ADC

Analog to Digital Converter.
ADC takes a snapshot of an analog voltage at one instane in time and produces a digital output which represents the input analog voltage. The digital output value is stored in ADC value register.
The number of binary bits that represent the value of ADC makes the resolution of an ADC.
For example, with 8-bit ADC, the resolution is 255 (2^8 -1). So more bit mean more accurate.
Voltage reference is normaly the maximum Input voltage of the ADC.
